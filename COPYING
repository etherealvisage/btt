This project contains trigraph data extracted from the Names Corpus, which is
provided under the following license:

----

Names Corpus, Version 1.3 (1994-03-29)
Copyright (C) 1991 Mark Kantrowitz
Additions by Bill Ross

This corpus contains 5001 female names and 2943 male names, sorted
alphabetically, one per line.

You may use the lists of names for any purpose, so long as credit is
given in any published work. You may also redistribute the list if you
provide the recipients with a copy of this README file. The lists are
not in the public domain (I retain the copyright on the lists) but are
freely redistributable.  If you have any additions to the lists of
names, I would appreciate receiving them.
