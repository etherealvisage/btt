Some notes on how objects are referenced:
- Direct object use should be limited to within a function scope when possible,
    or at most between private helper functions in a single class. Any time an
    object is passed around between modules, an object::ref should be used
    instead.
- Object IDs should not be used except by object:: namespace code. object::ref
    instances are lightweight enough. Using them as hashing keys is acceptable,
    or as unique identifiers for the purposes of human pretty-printing.
